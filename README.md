# react-native-orm
ORM for React Native.

It uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)-like approach and syntax ([Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/eloquent) and [Query Builder](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/queries)). It uses  *SQLite* storage by default.

### Installation:
react-native-orm uses [react-native-sqlite-storage](https://github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage) to interact to SQLite database so you should install it first.
